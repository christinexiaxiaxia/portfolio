	            <p>// 42 min 9 sec video, 5 × 7 in book, interactive installation (oscilloscope, microphone, script).</p>

	            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eyl2Q4M3hJM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;" style="visibility:visible;" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	            <p class="works caption">// 42 min 9 sec on-location performance of <i>We have only just met (Scene 1)</i>.</p>

	            <p><i>Thank you for reminding me</i> is an ongoing project that creates new connections with our surrounding spaces by embracing the mistranslation of old ideas. Rather than taking a flawed approach to adapting valuable yet somewhat outdated writings and beliefs from the past, this work attempts to find beauty in the bits and pieces that are lost in translation while still acknowledging both the past and present. This project will continually iterate by pairing new texts with new locations, resulting in a growing number of documented performances/scenes that hold unique connections with their respective spaces.</p>

	            <p>The work is composed of three parts: a video documentation of the on-location performance, a book made from the logged speech-to-text of said performance, and an interactive installation of the oscilloscope and a script of the selected piece of writing.</p>

	            <p class="works caption">// Interactive installation: the microphone and script sit on one side of the door while viewers can watch the text on the oscilloscope from the other side, out of range of the speaker’s voice.</p>

	            <p>The first scene is called <i>We have only just met</i> and was based on translating the introductory chapter of Lauren Elkin’s <i>Flâneuse: Women Walk the City in Paris, New York, Tokyo, Venice, and London</i>. While personally I find gaps within and disagree with her writing approach in some places, she vocalizes an importance in not forgetting about the <i>flâneur</i> by trying to find a place for the role in today’s urban landscape; outside of its original definition for the bourgeois French man.</p>

	            <p id="no-bottom-margin">Using the old technology of an oscilloscope, the more contemporary tech development of Google’s <i>Cloud Speech-to-Text</i>, and my own flawed reading of the chapter, I set myself in the alleys hidden within Toronto for my performance. The text generated from my reading was then taken to create a 183-page book of Elkin’s original 21-page chapter.</p>

	            <p>// Typeface (regular and italic), 16 × 36 in specimen poster.</p>

	            <p>Swooshes, ink traps, and alternate glyphs galore, <i>Defunkt</i> is a new typeface that carries on the tradition of weird and awkward grotesques. This is an avenue that has absolutely already been explored, but why not keep having fun? <i>Defunkt</i> seeks to inherit the conventions that define its predecessors but implements glyphs with high-contrast and dramatic strokes. With display use as their goal, characters slope in and out with gusto to produce unusual and energetic forms. Where strokes are often thin, they are thick; where they are usually wide and strong, forms are pinched and narrow; letterforms shrink, grow, and confidently flare out.</p>

	            <p>// Performance, monitor, computer mouse, staple gun, and participants’ illustrations.</p>

	            <p><i>Grave Eternity</i> is a web-based installation and performance piece that requires participants to take a few minutes to respond to a portrait of the man featured in the frame through drawing or writing. I then collect people’s contributions and use a staple gun to violently attach them to the wall, surrounding the frame with eclectic and mostly uninformed reactions to the subject of the image.</p>

	        	<p>The man in the image is Francis Galton, one of the early contributors of racial sciences and creator of term <i>eugenics</i>—the practice of correlating physiology to intellect and taking action and affecting policy to reflect their beliefs. This piece is an act of disenchantment towards Galton—an “anti-shrine”, unceremonious and misinformed. It removes the power of controlling his own public perception by re-appropriating his image and his personal history to endlessly loop and generate. Similarly to how the photos of anonymous individuals documented during expeditions rest in archives or databases completely separated from any shred of their actual humanity or real self, I have created a ritual and “alter” to create the same experience for this scientist, no longer allowing his image rest peacefully. This work is a part of my undergraduate capstone project to be completed in May 2020 that addresses the issue of disinterring history and speaking about the pain of others.</p>

	            <p class="works">This site is a web-poster made to promote a possible series of events for <i>Monday Night Seminars</i> presented by the McLuhan Centre of Culture and Technology. With the series being inspired by McLuhan’s <i>The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man</i>, the idea of an ‘industrialized folklore’ seeped into the the composition, selected typefaces, choice of colour, and user interaction. Rather than this “folklore” being based in distant stories from the past, the types of cultural narratives McLuhan addresses in his essays looks to technology and the popular culture that has grown around it.</p>

	            <p><i>大哥</i> (dà gē) is an interactive installation made as a part of another project, <i><a class="to-vernacular">Vernacular Beauty</a></i>. The Communist Party has been governing China for over the past 60 years and even though the ways in which society functions and communicates has shifted an unfathomable amount with the ever growing presence of the internet within every facet of our lives, the Chinese government continues to assert their control over its citizens even in this new digital age. Even though Chairman Mao’s time in office has been over for decades, just as his portrait looks over Tiananmen Square, this digitized version of his image follows the viewer even closer than before, just as China’s government has an even stronger clutch against their citizens’ access to information within a digital space.</p>

	            <p>Images of the former Chairman’s face have been collected from a wide and expansive collection of propaganda posters created in during Mao’s time of governance over the People’s Republic of China. These depictions of his visage range from wise and stoic to joyous and loveable.</p>

	            <p id="no-bottom-margin">The country’s national anthem plays on repeat, only increasing in volume when the user steps away to get the “bigger picture”, while being closer to the installation lowers the volume, making this overt display of nationalism fade away into the background.</p>

	            <p><i>Vernacular Beauty</i> is an ongoing process of self-reflection, discussion, and craft that takes the visual artefacts of propaganda and dissects them, hoping to isolate parts of their beauty that stem from their pervasive visual vernacular that weren’t yet clear to the viewer, or even myself. By breaking apart the inherently political art/design objects created for propaganda to distill them to just their visual elements, when reassembling them, what’s left of their original messages and agendas have been reconstructed into a new meaning, and one that doesn’t necessarily hold the same amount of intent and purpose as its source material.</p>

	            <p>While it may be some sort of aimless theme that prevails throughout each component of the project, it’s one that’s shaped by the conversation between me as “the maker” and the source material. This conversation shifts back and forth, weaves and forks, and also leads to some dead ends, but every part of it adds another layer to this new colloquially developed theme within the project as a whole.</p>

	            <p>// A pair of 5 × 7 in hardcover books.</p>

	            <img class="enlarge works no-top-margin" src="img/essentially-anonymous-perps.gif">

	            <p><i>Essentially Anonymous</i> is a two-part installation comprised of two books, one that can touched and flipped through and another that is out-of-reach and unknowable. Both books are comprised of expedition photographs collected from the American Museum of Natural History’s digital archives; the untouchable book in the corner is filled with nameless photographs of people taken by researchers during these expeditions while the in-reach book puts the faces of said researchers on display for viewers to examine. These images are interspersed with a poem addressing the conflicts within the act of speaking for others and documenting experiences outside of your own. This work is a part of my undergraduate capstone project to be completed in May 2020 that addresses the issue of disinterring history and speaking about the pain of others.</p>

	            <img class="enlarge no-top-margin" src="img/essentially-anonymous2.jpg">

	            <p class="works caption">// The untouchable book filled with portraits of anonymous individuals. Their portraits only barely peak out through slivers between each page.</p>

	            <p class="works margin-top">The untouchable book rests above the viewer’s head, with its pages almost out of sight, positioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_corner" target="_blank"><i>icon corner</i></a> to pay a modest tribute to these anonymous individuals by transforming the book they reside in into a type of worship space or alter. Instead of their anonymity taking away from their individuality, this type of anonymity removes these people’s faces and bodies from display altogether and returns the control of visibility back to these individuals. In contrast, the book that viewers are able to touch and see is filled with images of the expeditioners, the ones that have performed questionable acts of documentation. Both books are nearly identical: same number of pages, same text, same size. The only difference is the portraits that have been swapped out. With antiquated and unethical anthropological research practices often putting the most vulnerable people on display, this pair of books does the opposite by putting the perpetrators on display.</p>

	            <p>// Multimedia installation exhibit.</p>

	            <p>This exhibition explores the developing relationship between generative methods of visual design and the visual culture of memes. Through research it has become evident that the inflation of meme value has increased at an exponential rate since the earliest recorded search term analytics from Google. The graphing of search terms we have compiled aims to support our thesis that the over-saturation of memes within the present visual culture could paint a dystopian near-future for the very culture in which they are present. Thsi project was made in collaboration with <!-- <a class="link" href="http://colewielgosz.com/" target="_blank">Cole Wielgosz</a> -->Cole Wielgosz.</p>

	            <p class="works caption">// <i>Loss.jpg</i> looks forward to the future of corporate Twitter memes created by marketing teams and their infiltration into colloquial visual culture. It asks: what does a near-future look like where corporate interests infiltrate the culture of memes as a whole, injecting corporate messages and slogans successfully into popularized meme formats? This generative work pulls tweets from “#ad” in real time and converts the tweets into the visual format of four different generations of memes: an advice animal, rage comic, deep fried, and fantasy object labelling meme are all generated using the same #ad tweet. This piece addresses the disintegrating distinction between authentic and corporate memes and the possibility of weaponized memes in order to forward political, social, or financial agendas.</p>

Through the use of code and physical computing, the user does surgery on a grape, referencing <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/they-did-surgery-on-a-grape" target="_blank">a popular meme in late 2018</a>. The result of this “surgery” is an interactive generative installation—every time the user touches the scalpel to the grape, a new layer is added to the meme format. This projection of the future of memes being brought into physical space pushes the boundaries of the traditional perception of memes and makes the current digital space that they occupy more apparent.</p>

There is a foreseeable link between the visual culture of memes and the visual culture of contemporary art exhibition through code, as well as the documentation or preservation of the ephemeral Web. The visual outputs that comprise this piece were created through Processing—popular vines were played and visualized based on their amplitude and frequency. Sourced from the now-defunct video-sharing platform, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/vine" target="_blank">Vine</a>, we have memorialized these fleeting cultural moments into tangible outcomes.

	            <p><i>Save Us All!</i> is an edition of prints that satirizes The Royal Family’s perfectly planned and measured public image to highlight the gossip and tabloid news that keeps the family relevant and present in popular culture. While exaggerating the monarchy’s grandeur by transforming their balcony photo from the <a href="https://www.royal.uk/trooping-colour" target="_blank">Trooping the Colour</a> ceremony into the image of saints, these “holy” portraits are overlayed with loud and brash text—the background is composed of tabloid articles that gossip and speculate about the family’s lives and the foreground consists of the words from <i>God Save the Queen</i> stretched, scaled, and transformed into eye-catching headlines and titles.

	            <p>// 4 × 5 in books.</p>

	            <p><i>Human Artifacts</i> is an anthology of algorithmically-made stories that reveal the ways in which our digital culture can artificially reflect intimate emotional experiences. Trained from ImageNet’s non-human categories, images were bred together to create morphing sequences that somehow still capture human-like figures. Despite the categories not meant to portray humans, the few people that have snuck into other categories of objects and landscapes are able to creep their way in to the series of uncanny images. Although the algorithm that produced these photos are not meant to recognize a human figure, they are still able to tell a narrative.

	            <p class="margin-top">Below is the afterword of the book:</p>
	            
	            <p class="works afterword">None of these images were meant to include human figures. At the very least, they do not include any genes that might hint at their anthropormorphic origins. Barbershop, running shoe, tree frog, flamingo, Schipperke, fire engine are all things that these images proclaim themselves to be. But, there’s something more to this, isn’t there? There must be, or how else am I able to see a child grow up or watch two lovers drift apart?</p>

	            <p class="works afterword">Of course, such a feat is unachievable without some level of human intervention that shapes and manipulates these uncanny forms into something that feels a bit more familiar. These images were selected, sequenced, and titled by myself, but their actual creation was dictated by something beyond our shared understanding of image-making. In other words, each image was made using machine-learning algorithms that bred one shadowy frame with another to form each of these almost-humans.</p>

	            <p class="works afterword">Does it surprise you to know that the neural network that produced these portraits does not even know what a human is? These networks do not learn in the same way we learn. While they were modelled after the human brain, in reality these algorithms were made to read and identify pixels and make relationships between them without the need to understand what meaning was held within these 512 × 512 grids. Images, along with their assigned tags and labels, were fed to them by people—people with their own complex lives, partialities, and preferences. A machine-learning algorithm can only learn and produce from what its been given. Yet, 81.1% tub, 12.3% angora, 3.5% monastery, and 3.1% lumbermill produces something so powerful and tactile that you end up forgetting about all of that.</p>

				<p class="works afterword">This isn’t to say that the making of these images are immune to human influence. Rather, it is this bias in its very nature that has subconsciously guided the selection of training images to allow scatterings of people to appear in the backgrounds or sidelines of the targetted subjects. It is these peripheral figures that reemerge into the ghostly entities that fill these pages.</p>

				<p class="works afterword" id="no-bottom-margin">The making of Human Artifacts was possible thanks to Joel Simon’s Artbreeder project.</p>

	            <p id="no-bottom-margin">The use of the phone flashlight draws on the experience of being at a concert, but contrasts with the installation’s experience of being in a much smaller space with much less noise. The dark room and trance-like visuals that glow between pinks and blues along with the control the user has over the movement of the text establishes an intimate and responsive relationship between person and screen.</p>

	            <p class="works header">RANDOM_INDEX: The Works of Sulki and Min, <span class="works date">2018</span></p>

	            <p>// 8 × 10 in brochures..</p>

	            <p>This 12-page brochure is an accompanying piece for a mock-exhibition "/RANDOM_INDEX" for the designers Sulki and Min. The booklet features some of their works alongside interview questions and answers. Based off of <a href="http://www.sulki-min.com/wp/index-random/" target="_blank">their website</a> that features randomly generated galleries of their works and even their names in the top left corner switching between English and Korean when refreshed, the placement, size, leading, and font of text was determined by sets of rules based off of number of words, beginning letters, and other values in each paragraph.</p>

	            <img class="enlarge works" src="img/random-index2.jpg">

	            <p>Sulki and Min's design often revolves around interchangeable elements and adaptability into different formats and aspect ratios, so the colour scheme and printing was also kept in mind while arranging the images and text. The booklets can be printed in different variations of colours and paper while still being legibile, allowing the content to be printed for colour or black and white, and also on varying qualities of paper.</p>

	            <p class="works header">Shadows Talk<!--, <span class="works date">2018</span>--></p>

	            <p>// 2 channel audio, photographs, webpage (headphone use recommended).</p>

	            <p>Images of deteriorating poster were collected as a source for these audio works. Using the idea of psychogeography as a starting point, this piece captures the visual experience of a poster in a purely auditory experience, layering pieces of conversations about the subject of each poster. The volume, clarity, and direction of each conversation fragment is based on the legibility and position of each poster within the image. Listeners can experience each time and location with the soft sounds of traffic in the distance behind the aural collage that moves back and forth from one ear to the other.</p>

	            <p>// 6 × 9 in book.</p>

	            <p>A hand-bound copy of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus with an introduction of Donna Haraway’s A Cyborg Manifesto. This book design translates Shelley’s literary classic into contemporary times; Haraway’s essay establishes a more modern context for the novel, as does the fragmented and transitioning type as it shifts from serif, to sans-serif, to monospaced. The book’s introduction is printed on a cream duotone with the rest of the novel printed on a toothier subi paper.</p>
