			    <p class="header">Hi!</p>

			    <p>
			    	I’m Christine Xia and I am currently studying graphic design at OCAD University. I enjoy type design, the web, creating systems and placing things into them, interactive and generative media, book binding, making things that look cool, performance and installations, and typesetting very large lengths of text.

	            <p>// 42 min 9 sec video, 5 × 7 in book, interactive installation (oscilloscope, microphone, script).</p>

	            <p><i>Thank you for reminding me</i> is an ongoing project that creates new connections with our surrounding spaces by embracing the mistranslation of old ideas. Rather than taking a flawed approach to adapting valuable yet somewhat outdated writings and beliefs from the past, this work attempts to find beauty in the bits and pieces that are lost in translation while still acknowledging both the past and present. This project will continually iterate by pairing new texts with new locations, resulting in a growing number of documented performances/scenes that hold unique connections with their respective spaces.</p>

	            <p>The work is composed of three parts: a video documentation of the on-location performance, a book made from the logged speech-to-text of said performance, and an interactive installation of the oscilloscope and a script of the selected piece of writing.</p>

	            <p>The first scene is called <i>We have only just met</i> and was based on translating the introductory chapter of Lauren Elkin’s <i>Flâneuse: Women Walk the City in Paris, New York, Tokyo, Venice, and London</i>. While personally I find gaps within and disagree with her writing approach in some places, she vocalizes an importance in not forgetting about the <i>flâneur</i> by trying to find a place for the role in today’s urban landscape; outside of its original definition for the bourgeois French man.</p>

	            <p id="no-bottom-margin">Using the old technology of an oscilloscope, the more contemporary tech development of Google’s <i>Cloud Speech-to-Text</i>, and my own flawed reading of the chapter, I set myself in the alleys hidden within Toronto for my performance. The text generated from my reading was then taken to create a 183-page book of Elkin’s original 21-page chapter.</p>

	            <p>// Typeface (regular and italic), 16 × 36 in specimen poster.</p>

	            <p>Swooshes, ink traps, and alternate glyphs galore, <i>Defunkt</i> is a new typeface that carries on the tradition of weird and awkward grotesques. This is an avenue that has absolutely already been explored, but why not keep having fun? <i>Defunkt</i> seeks to inherit the conventions that define its predecessors but implements glyphs with high-contrast and dramatic strokes. With display use as their goal, characters slope in and out with gusto to produce unusual and energetic forms. Where strokes are often thin, they are thick; where they are usually wide and strong, forms are pinched and narrow; letterforms shrink, grow, and confidently flare out.</p>

	            <p>// Framed installation, digital images, sound.</p>

	            <p><i>大哥</i> (dà gē) is an interactive installation made as a part of another project, <i><a class="to-vernacular">Vernacular Beauty</a></i>. The Communist Party has been governing China for over the past 60 years and even though the ways in which society functions and communicates has shifted an unfathomable amount with the ever growing presence of the internet within every facet of our lives, the Chinese government continues to assert their control over its citizens even in this new digital age. Even though Chairman Mao’s time in office has been over for decades, just as his portrait looks over Tiananmen Square, this digitized version of his image follows the viewer even closer than before, just as China’s government has an even stronger clutch against their citizens’ access to information within a digital space.</p>

	            <p>Images of the former Chairman’s face have been collected from a wide and expansive collection of propaganda posters created in during Mao’s time of governance over the People’s Republic of China. These depictions of his visage range from wise and stoic to joyous and loveable.</p>

	            <p id="no-bottom-margin">The country’s national anthem plays on repeat, only increasing in volume when the user steps away to get the “bigger picture”, while being closer to the installation lowers the volume, making this overt display of nationalism fade away into the background.</p>

	            <p>// Digital images, prints, interactive installation, writing.</p>

	            <p><i>Vernacular Beauty</i> is an ongoing process of self-reflection, discussion, and craft that takes the visual artefacts of propaganda and dissects them, hoping to isolate parts of their beauty that stem from their pervasive visual vernacular that weren’t yet clear to the viewer, or even myself. By breaking apart the inherently political art/design objects created for propaganda to distill them to just their visual elements, when reassembling them, what’s left of their original messages and agendas have been reconstructed into a new meaning, and one that doesn’t necessarily hold the same amount of intent and purpose as its source material.</p>

	            <p>While it may be some sort of aimless theme that prevails throughout each component of the project, it’s one that’s shaped by the conversation between me as “the maker” and the source material. This conversation shifts back and forth, weaves and forks, and also leads to some dead ends, but every part of it adds another layer to this new colloquially developed theme within the project as a whole.</p>

	            <p>// Multimedia installation exhibit.</p>

	            <p>This exhibition explores the developing relationship between generative methods of visual design and the visual culture of memes. Through research it has become evident that the inflation of meme value has increased at an exponential rate since the earliest recorded search term analytics from Google. The graphing of search terms we have compiled aims to support our thesis that the over-saturation of memes within the present visual culture could paint a dystopian near-future for the very culture in which they are present. Made in collaboration with <a class="link" href="http://colewielgosz.com/" target="_blank">Cole Wielgosz</a>.</p>

	            <p class="works caption">// <i>Loss.jpg</i> looks forward to the future of corporate Twitter memes created by marketing teams and their infiltration into colloquial visual culture. It asks: what does a near-future look like where corporate interests infiltrate the culture of memes as a whole, injecting corporate messages and slogans successfully into popularized meme formats? This generative work pulls tweets from “#ad” in real time and converts the tweets into the visual format of four different generations of memes: an advice animal, rage comic, deep fried, and fantasy object labelling meme are all generated using the same #ad tweet. This piece addresses the disintegrating distinction between authentic and corporate memes and the possibility of weaponized memes in order to forward political, social, or financial agendas.</p>

Through the use of code and physical computing, the user does surgery on a grape, referencing <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/they-did-surgery-on-a-grape" target="_blank">a popular meme in late 2018</a>. The result of this “surgery” is an interactive generative installation—every time the user touches the scalpel to the grape, a new layer is added to the meme format. This projection of the future of memes being brought into physical space pushes the boundaries of the traditional perception of memes and makes the current digital space that they occupy more apparent.</p>

The visual outputs that comprise this piece were created through Processing—popular vines were played and visualized based on their amplitude and frequency. Sourced from the now-defunct video-sharing platform, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/vine" target="_blank">Vine</a>, we have memorialized these fleeting cultural moments into tangible outcomes. This piece addresses how we can capture the volatile culture of the Internet and how these future meme-based works could exist in a gallery space.</p>

	            <p>// 18 × 24 in posters.</p>

	            <p>Complimentary mock posters to promote Toronto’s International Festival of Authors. These two posters—one that uses only typography and one that also includes image—display a nostalgic motif of library book sign-out cards as their visual identity.</p>

	            <p>// Interactive sound and 3-channel video installation.</p>

	            <p>An installation made in Processing that allows the audience to use their phone flashlight to interact and have a dialogue with the lyrics of the song Downtown by Babeo Baggins.</p>

	            <div style="margin-top:-1.3rem;margin-bottom:1rem;padding:56.25% 0 2.5rem 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/316428305?autoplay=0&loop=1&color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="visibility:visible;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

	            <p id="no-bottom-margin">The use of the phone flashlight draws on the experience of being at a concert, but contrasts with the installation’s experience of being in a much smaller space with much less noise. The dark room and trance-like visuals that glow between pinks and blues along with the control the user has over the movement of the text establishes an intimate and responsive relationship between person and screen.</p>

	            <p>// 8 × 10 in brochures..</p>

	            <p>This 12-page brochure is an accompanying piece for a mock-exhibition "/RANDOM_INDEX" for the designers Sulki and Min. The booklet features some of their works alongside interview questions and answers. Based off of <a href="http://www.sulki-min.com/wp/index-random/" target="_blank">their website</a> that features randomly generated galleries of their works and even their names in the top left corner switching between English and Korean when refreshed, the placement, size, leading, and font of text was determined by sets of rules based off of number of words, beginning letters, and other values in each paragraph.</p>

	            <img class="works" src="img/random-index2.jpg">

	            <p>Sulki and Min's design often revolves around interchangeable elements and adaptability into different formats and aspect ratios, so the colour scheme and printing was also kept in mind while arranging the images and text. The booklets can be printed in different variations of colours and paper while still being legibile, allowing the content to be printed for colour or black and white, and also on varying qualities of paper.</p>

	            <p>// 2 channel audio, photographs, webpage (headphone use recommended).</p>

	            <p>Images of deteriorating poster were collected as a source for these audio works. Using the idea of psychogeography as a starting point, this piece captures the visual experience of a poster in a purely auditory experience, layering pieces of conversations about the subject of each poster. The volume, clarity, and direction of each conversation fragment is based on the legibility and position of each poster within the image. Listeners can experience each time and location with the soft sounds of traffic in the distance behind the aural collage that moves back and forth from one ear to the other.</p>

	            <p>// 36 × 48 in poster, mobile app prototype, 4.5 × 9 in booklet.</p>

	            <p>A three-part project to promote a mock lecture series featuring talks from six contemporary designers. The isometric typographic structure that binds the three different forms is inspired by the structure of a construction platform on top of a highrise building. Each of the talks confronts the problems that exist in our cultural systems and inspire and promote an attitude to resolve these issues: they break down then build up the system.</p>

	            <p>// 6 × 9 in book.</p>

	            <p>A hand-bound copy of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus with an introduction of Donna Haraway’s A Cyborg Manifesto. This book design translates Shelley’s literary classic into contemporary times; Haraway’s essay establishes a more modern context for the novel, as does the fragmented and transitioning type as it shifts from serif, to sans-serif, to monospaced. The book’s introduction is printed on a cream duotone with the rest of the novel printed on a toothier subi paper.</p>
