			    <p class="header">Hi!</p>
			    <p>
			    	I’m Christine Xia and I am currently studying graphic design at OCAD University. I enjoy type design, the web, creating systems and placing things into them, interactive and generative media, book binding, making things that look cool, performance and installations, and typesetting very large lengths of text.

	            <p>// 42 min 9 sec video, 5 × 7 in book, interactive installation (oscilloscope, microphone, script).</p>

	            <p><i>Thank you for reminding me</i> is an ongoing project that creates new connections with our surrounding spaces by embracing the mistranslation of old ideas. Rather than taking a flawed approach to adapting valuable yet somewhat outdated writings and beliefs from the past, this work attempts to find beauty in the bits and pieces that are lost in translation while still acknowledging both the past and present. This project will continually iterate by pairing new texts with new locations, resulting in a growing number of documented performances/scenes that hold unique connections with their respective spaces.</p>

	            <p>The work is composed of three parts: a video documentation of the on-location performance, a book made from the logged speech-to-text of said performance, and an interactive installation of the oscilloscope and a script of the selected piece of writing.</p>

	            <p>The first scene is called <i>We have only just met</i> and was based on translating the introductory chapter of Lauren Elkin’s <i>Flâneuse: Women Walk the City in Paris, New York, Tokyo, Venice, and London</i>. While personally I find gaps within and disagree with her writing approach in some places, she vocalizes an importance in not forgetting about the <i>flâneur</i> by trying to find a place for the role in today’s urban landscape; outside of its original definition for the bourgeois French man.</p>

	            <p id="no-bottom-margin">Using the old technology of an oscilloscope, the more contemporary tech development of Google’s <i>Cloud Speech-to-Text</i>, and my own flawed reading of the chapter, I set myself in the alleys hidden within Toronto for my performance. The text generated from my reading was then taken to create a 183-page book of Elkin’s original 21-page chapter.</p>

	            <p>// Typeface (regular and italic), 16 × 36 in specimen poster.</p>

	            <p>Swooshes, ink traps, and alternate glyphs galore, <i>Defunkt</i> is a new typeface that carries on the tradition of weird and awkward grotesques. This is an avenue that has absolutely already been explored, but why not keep having fun? <i>Defunkt</i> seeks to inherit the conventions that define its predecessors but implements glyphs with high-contrast and dramatic strokes. With display use as their goal, characters slope in and out with gusto to produce unusual and energetic forms. Where strokes are often thin, they are thick; where they are usually wide and strong, forms are pinched and narrow; letterforms shrink, grow, and confidently flare out.</p>

	            <p>// Framed installation, digital images, sound.</p>

	            <p><i>大哥</i> (dà gē) is an interactive installation made as a part of another project, <i><a class="to-vernacular">Vernacular Beauty</a></i>. The Communist Party has been governing China for over the past 60 years and even though the ways in which society functions and communicates has shifted an unfathomable amount with the ever growing presence of the internet within every facet of our lives, the Chinese government continues to assert their control over its citizens even in this new digital age. Even though Chairman Mao’s time in office has been over for decades, just as his portrait looks over Tiananmen Square, this digitized version of his image follows the viewer even closer than before, just as China’s government has an even stronger clutch against their citizens’ access to information within a digital space.</p>

	            <div style="margin-top:-1.3rem;margin-bottom:0.5rem;padding:56.25% 0 2.5rem 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/349989346?autoplay=0&loop=1&color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="visibility:visible;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

	            <p>Images of the former Chairman’s face have been collected from a wide and expansive collection of propaganda posters created in during Mao’s time of governance over the People’s Republic of China. These depictions of his visage range from wise and stoic to joyous and loveable.</p>

	            <p id="no-bottom-margin">The country’s national anthem plays on repeat, only increasing in volume when the user steps away to get the “bigger picture”, while being closer to the installation lowers the volume, making this overt display of nationalism fade away into the background.</p>

	            <p>// Digital images, prints, interactive installation, writing.</p>

	            <p><i>Vernacular Beauty</i> is an ongoing process of self-reflection, discussion, and craft that takes the visual artefacts of propaganda and dissects them, hoping to isolate parts of their beauty that stem from their pervasive visual vernacular that weren’t yet clear to the viewer, or even myself. By breaking apart the inherently political art/design objects created for propaganda to distill them to just their visual elements, when reassembling them, what’s left of their original messages and agendas have been reconstructed into a new meaning, and one that doesn’t necessarily hold the same amount of intent and purpose as its source material.</p>

	            <p>While it may be some sort of aimless theme that prevails throughout each component of the project, it’s one that’s shaped by the conversation between me as “the maker” and the source material. This conversation shifts back and forth, weaves and forks, and also leads to some dead ends, but every part of it adds another layer to this new colloquially developed theme within the project as a whole.</p>

	            <p>A paperback book and magazine for the screenplay of “The Death of Stalin”, written by Armando Iannucci and David Schneider. While the former serves to be more functional and the latter is more expressive, both employ visual tropes of propaganda, and particularly the Russian constructivist style in the magazine.</p>

	            <p>The book emulates the look and feel of a “little red book”, formatting the typical look of a screenplay into a more dense text and the magazine uses geometric and stylized letterforms to create spreads based on the visual compositions and mood of each of the featured scenes.</p>

	            <p>Images of deteriorating poster were collected as a source for these audio works. Using the idea of psychogeography as a starting point, this piece captures the visual experience of a poster in a purely auditory experience, layering pieces of conversations about the subject of each poster. The volume, clarity, and direction of each conversation fragment is based on the legibility and position of each poster within the image. Listeners can experience each time and location with the soft sounds of traffic in the distance behind the aural collage that moves back and forth from one ear to the other.</p>
